These are some of the key Old Testament verses that are often interpreted as messianic prophecies by Christians, pointing to the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

# Debunked Topics

## Topic 1. **Born of a Virgin**: The prophesy of Isaiah 7:14 ( Therefore the Lord Himself shall give you a sign: Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His name Immanuel.  ) is not for Jesus but for Ahaz

Isaiah 7:14 is a well-known prophecy in the Old Testament, which says:

*"Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: Behold, the young woman (or virgin) shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel."* (Isaiah 7:14)

In the context of the Old Testament, Isaiah gave this prophecy during a time of political crisis for the kingdom of Judah. King Ahaz of Judah was facing the threat of invasion by the kings of Aram (Syria) and Israel (the northern kingdom). Isaiah delivered this prophecy to assure Ahaz that God was still with Judah and would deliver them.

Here’s how it could be understood within its own historical context:

1. **Immediate Context**: Isaiah spoke to King Ahaz in the 8th century BCE, offering this prophecy as a sign that God would protect the kingdom of Judah from its enemies. The child referred to in the prophecy, whose name means "God with us" (Immanuel), was likely a symbol of hope and divine presence during this period of crisis.

2. **Historical Fulfillment**: Some scholars suggest that the child may have been a member of the royal family, possibly Isaiah’s own son (as mentioned later in Isaiah 8), or the child of a young woman in Ahaz’s court. This child would serve as a sign that, before he grew to the age of accountability, the threat posed by Aram and Israel would have passed.

   In Isaiah 8:3–4, Isaiah’s own child, named Maher-shalal-hash-baz, is born, and the prophecy of deliverance is re-emphasized, indicating that the fulfillment of the prophecy in Isaiah 7:14 may have been closely tied to Isaiah’s own time, and specifically to the political events surrounding Ahaz.

3. **Immanuel as a Sign of Divine Presence**: The name "Immanuel," meaning "God with us," indicates that the birth of this child was meant to serve as a sign that God had not abandoned His people. It assured Ahaz and the people of Judah that God’s presence was still with them despite the looming threat of invasion.

Thus, within its Old Testament context, Isaiah 7:14 seems to refer to a specific historical situation during the reign of Ahaz, with the promise of divine deliverance from the immediate political threat. The prophecy may have been fulfilled through the birth of a child in Ahaz’s time, symbolizing God’s protective presence over Judah during a time of turmoil.



###  Why a virgin will conceived and bear a son? The nation of Israel is metaphorically compared to a man or an individual so it may refer to a nation established
There are several instances in the Old Testament where the nation of Israel is metaphorically compared to a man or an individual. This metaphor is often used to describe Israel's relationship with God and the covenant they share. A few examples include:

1. **Isaiah 42:1** - Israel is referred to as the "Servant of the Lord." Though in some instances, the servant refers to an individual (often interpreted as the Messiah), in other places, it refers to the nation of Israel as a collective servant of God:  
   *"Behold my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights; I have put my Spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the nations."*

2. **Hosea 11:1** - The nation of Israel is spoken of as God's "son":  
   *"When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son."*  
   Here, God speaks of Israel as a son whom He delivered out of Egypt, portraying the nation in terms of a familial relationship.

3. **Ezekiel 16** - In this chapter, the prophet Ezekiel describes the history of Israel as that of an abandoned child whom God cared for and raised into a mature person, only for the nation to turn away in unfaithfulness:  
   *"I made you flourish like a plant of the field. And you grew up and became tall and arrived at full adornment."*  
   This passage metaphorically represents Israel as a person who matures under God's care but later rebels.

4. **Jeremiah 31:20** - Israel is referred to as God's dear child:  
   *"Is Ephraim my dear son? Is he my darling child? For as often as I speak against him, I do remember him still. Therefore my heart yearns for him; I will surely have mercy on him, declares the LORD."*

These metaphors often serve to illustrate the intimate, covenantal relationship between God and Israel, portraying the nation as a single entity, often likened to a person, child, or servant in order to convey spiritual lessons and messages.



### Prophesy: Prophesy of Roman Empire will change the calendar and the laws of Jews using new testament
Daniel 7:25
25 And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.

### Lecture: Sabbath
Isaiah 56:2 keep Sabbath, not profaning it.
The law for observing the Sabbath is found in several places in the Old Testament, particularly in the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy. The Sabbath is the seventh day of the week, set aside for rest and worship, and it is established as part of the Ten Commandments. Here are the main passages:

### 1. **Exodus 20:8-11 (The Ten Commandments)**
   - *“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant, or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.”*

   This passage provides the basic command to observe the Sabbath and explains its connection to God's rest after creation.

### 2. **Deuteronomy 5:12-15 (The Ten Commandments Repeated)**
   - *“Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as the Lord your God commanded you. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter or your male servant or your female servant or your ox or your donkey or any of your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates, that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you. You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God brought you out from there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the Lord your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.”*

   This version emphasizes the importance of the Sabbath as a reminder of the Israelites' deliverance from slavery in Egypt.

### 3. **Leviticus 23:3**
   - *“Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation. You shall do no work. It is a Sabbath to the Lord in all your dwelling places.”*

   This passage describes the Sabbath as a day of rest and a holy assembly.

### 4. **Exodus 31:13-17**
   - *“You are to speak to the people of Israel and say, ‘Above all you shall keep my Sabbaths, for this is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I, the Lord, sanctify you... Therefore the people of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, observing the Sabbath throughout their generations, as a covenant forever. It is a sign forever between me and the people of Israel that in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed.’”*

   This passage emphasizes the Sabbath as a perpetual covenant and sign between God and the people of Israel.

These passages lay out the foundation for the observance of the Sabbath as a day of rest, holiness, and remembrance of both creation and the Israelites' deliverance from slavery. The Sabbath was central to the covenant relationship between God and the Israelites and was one of the defining features of their worship.
